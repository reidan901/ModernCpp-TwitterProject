# Introduction

Colibri is a Twitter clone we created for a project assignment for the modern C++ course. It offers its users features such as adding posts, interacting with them(likes,dislikes,retweets), adding friends etc.

Through this project we learned to develop a client server application using modern C++ features and to create a GUI using SFML.
